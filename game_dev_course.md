🎯 12-Month Roadmap – Self-Taught Game Dev to Hireable

⸻

Phase 1 – C++ & Unreal Foundations (Months 1–2)

Goal: Get comfortable in C++ & Unreal Engine, building small mechanics fast.

Weeks 1–2 – Modern C++ Basics

    •	Learn variables, loops, functions, classes, inheritance, pointers, references
    •	Understand header/source structure in C++
    •	Practice with tiny console programs (no Unreal yet) to drill syntax

Portfolio task:

    •	C++ console “RPG Stat Calculator” (inputs: level, weapon, armor → outputs: final damage/defense)

⸻

Weeks 3–4 – Unreal Engine Setup & Blueprints

    •	Install Unreal Engine (latest LTS version)
    •	Learn Editor basics: viewport, content browser, world outliner, actors, components
    •	Learn Blueprints for quick prototypes
    •	Create first C++ Actor class and expose variables to Blueprint

Portfolio task:

    •	Create a simple player pawn that can move and jump using C++ for logic, Blueprint for inputs

⸻

Weeks 5–8 – Core Gameplay Building Blocks

    •	Player movement & camera controls
    •	Input mapping (keyboard/controller)
    •	Animation blueprint basics
    •	Basic combat system (melee or ranged)
    •	Intro to AI (navmesh, patrolling enemies)

Portfolio task:

    •	Build a “Combat Arena” demo: player vs AI enemies, health UI, respawning

Networking step:

    •	Join Unreal Slackers Discord & Unreal Forums
    •	Post WIP (work-in-progress) clips for feedback

⸻

Phase 2 – Gameplay Systems Mastery (Months 3–5)

Goal: Implement complex systems, polish feel, and start building a public portfolio presence.

Weeks 9–12 – AI & Game Interaction

    •	AI behavior trees, blackboards
    •	Detection systems (vision cones, hearing range)
    •	Simple inventory system (pickup, drop, equip)

Portfolio task:

    •	AI Guard demo: patrols, detects player, gives chase, loses track if player hides

⸻

Weeks 13–16 – Game Feel & Events

    •	Camera effects (shake, zoom, FOV changes)
    •	Particle systems for hits, dust, muzzle flash
    •	Trigger volumes for events (door opening, cutscenes)
    •	Timers & win/loss states

Portfolio task:

    •	Mini stealth level with patrolling AI, player hiding spots, triggered escape event

Networking step:

    •	Post your AI Guard demo on LinkedIn with short devlog text
    •	Tag #UnrealEngine #GameDev

⸻

Phase 3 – Systems Integration & Optimization (Months 6–8)

Goal: Learn to combine mechanics into full gameplay loops & make them run well.

Weeks 17–20 – Physics & Interaction
• Physics handles (grab/push objects)
• Destructible meshes
• Physics puzzles

Portfolio task:

    •	Physics puzzle room: push boxes to reach exit, pressure plates trigger doors

⸻

Weeks 21–24 – Optimization & Balancing

    •	Unreal profiler usage
    •	LOD setup
    •	Reducing draw calls
    •	Balancing difficulty and pacing

Portfolio task:

    •	Remaster an old demo with better performance and more polished player feel

Networking step:

    •	Enter a Game Jam (Ludum Dare, Unreal MegaJam) — even a small jam game is portfolio gold

⸻

Phase 4 – Hero Project & Hiring Prep (Months 9–12)

Goal: Build your flagship game demo, polish portfolio, and push networking hard.

Weeks 25–36 – Hero Project Build

    •	Combine core systems (movement, combat, AI, UI, events)
    •	Focus on 1–2 polished levels with great feel
    •	Add VFX, sound, polish

Portfolio task:

    •	Hero Project:

Example — Third-Person Action Demo with:

    •	Player combat (melee + ranged)
    •	AI enemies with varied behaviors
    •	Interactive environment
    •	Win condition

⸻

Weeks 37–48 – Final Polish & Launch

    •	Playtest, bug fix, iterate
    •	Package builds for Windows (Itch.io page)
    •	Record a gameplay trailer

Networking step:

    •	Post Hero Project trailer on LinkedIn, Twitter, Unreal forums
    •	Apply to:
    •	Gameplay Programmer
    •	Technical Gameplay Designer
    •	Junior Unreal Developer

⸻

📦 Portfolio Checklist

✅ Hero Project (1 polished, 5–10 min gameplay)
✅ Mechanic Demos (3–4 focused clips)
✅ GitHub repos (clean, documented)
✅ Itch.io with downloadable builds
✅ LinkedIn with gameplay GIFs & devlogs
✅ Game Jam participation badge (optional, but huge boost)

⸻

💡 Self-Taught Success Multiplier:
Every 2–3 weeks, post something online — even a 10-second clip of new mechanics. It builds visibility, proof of progress, and credibility that a resume can't.
